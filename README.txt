This is just a small test project with C# and XNA using Mesh instancing.
I started integrating JigLibX to get some physics going as well, but I didn't finish.
Currently I cannot work on this project but maybe in future I will.

The runnable program now does nothing more than displaying N instances of one mesh.
Instances can be added by pressing '+' (and CTRL to speed it up). Also you can move
through the world with mouse and WSAD.

What i originally intended was to build moving platforms and towers (hence the name),
where you could jump around Quake style. If I get around to it I will continue
working on it.
